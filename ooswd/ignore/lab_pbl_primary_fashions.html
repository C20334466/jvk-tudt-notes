      <h1>Problem-Based Learning Assignment: School Uniform Orders</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Your assignment is to write a Python program that automates online
          ordering for PrimaryFashions, a company that sells primary school
          uniforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Except where indicated, your program may assume that user input is
          going to be valid (i.e. error handling should be implemented only if
          stated as an explicit requirement).
        </li>
        <li>
          Where user input is required, suitable prompts must be provided, e.g.
          <span class="fw">Please enter your name: </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Where output is required, suitable descriptions must be provided, e.g.
          printing an order total might read
          <span class="fw">Your order total is €100</span> (not just
          <span class="fw">€100</span>).
        </li>
        <li>
          The program should:
          <ul>
            <li>
              print a title banner
              <span class="fw"
                >*********** PrimaryFashions Online Shop ***********</span
              >
              when it starts
            </li>
            <li>read in the user's name</li>
            <li>
              read in the user's post code, check that it is exactly seven
              characters long and that it consists of alphanumeric characters
              only (the string method <span class="fw">isalnum</span> can be
              used for this), then if the post code is invalid read it in again,
              repeating the process until a valid code is obtained
            </li>
            <li>
              modify the postcode so that any lower-case letters are converted
              to upper-case
            </li>
            <li>
              read in the name of the first child for whom a uniform is being
              ordered (so that the name can be embroidered)
            </li>
            <li>
              read in information about items that are being ordered for the
              child:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  item types: <strong>jacket</strong>, <strong>jumper</strong>;
                  one of these or both may be ordered for the child
                </li>
                <li>
                  item sizes: <strong>S (small)</strong>,
                  <strong>M (medium)</strong>, <strong>L (large)</strong>; one
                  size should apply to both items for the same child
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              ask the user if they wish to enter information for another child,
              repeating the process for as many children as the user wishes
            </li>
            <li>
              calculate the bill total if the prices are as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>small jumper: €25</li>
                <li>small jacket: €40</li>
                <li>
                  any medium-sized item: 6% more than the same type of item in
                  size S
                </li>
                <li>
                  any large-sized item: 10% more than the same type of item in
                  size S
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              print out an order summary, quoting the customer's name, postcode
              and order total
            </li>
            <li>
              print out the list of items (in any order), with lines in the
              form:
              <pre>

item_type   item_size   name_to_be_embroidered
			    </pre
              >
              e.g.
              <pre>

jumper   M   Emily Browne
jumper   S   Tom Browne
jacket   M   Emily Browne
			    </pre
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          TIP: You can accumulate a string containing the list of items in the
          same way you accumulate the order total, in the loop used for reading
          the input.
