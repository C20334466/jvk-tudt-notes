		<h2>Assignment</h2>
		<ol>
		    <li>Using <a href="mockaroo.com">mockaroo.com</a> create a csv file that has animal data (species, name, age, weight) for 200 animals.</li>
		    <li>Define an animal class that holds all these data and a zoo class that holds a list of animal objects, both with a suitable constructor.</li>
		    <li>Write a method in the zoo class that takes a file name as a parameter, then reads in the animal information from the file and adds all the animals to its list.</li>
		    <li>Write a method in the zoo class called <span class="fw">compile_transfer_list</span>. This should randomly pick 10 animals that need to be transfered and write all their information into a file called <em>transfer.csv</em> in comma-separated-value (CSV) format.</li>
		    <li>All the file input/output operations should be placed inside a <span class="fw">try/except</span> clauses.</li>
		    <li>Import the <span class="fw">numpy</span> package.</li>
		    <li>Write a method in the zoo class that converts weights from pounds to kilograms and the other way around, depending on a parameter. This method should map the list of animals to a list of weights and convert this to a numpy array before performing the conversion. Technically, this is quite unnecesary, but will give you a first taste for how numpy arrays work.</li>
		    <li>Another method should calculate the average weight of the animals and print it out, also with the use of a numpy array.</li>
		    <li>The classes should each be in a separate file and a third file called <em>main.py</em> should contain testing code which prints an easy-to-follow account of what is being tested and the results of the tests.</li>
