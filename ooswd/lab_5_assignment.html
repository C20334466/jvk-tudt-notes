		<h2>Assignment</h2>
		<p>Your assignment is to implement a stock checking application with the use of Python classes. The requirements are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>The application should consist of classes <span class="fw">Product</span> and <span class="fw">Shop</span> and a main program. Each class and the main program should be in a separate file (three files in all).</li>

		    <li>The <span class="fw">Product</span> class should have member variables for the product name, description and stock (string, string and integer respectively) and a constructor that takes parameters that populate each of the member variables.</li>
		    <li>The shop should hold a list of products and have functions for adding, removing and printing the list of products. It should also have a function that identifies the products that are low on stock (below 3) and prints a list of those products.</li>
		    <li>The file <em>main.py</em> should contain code for testing all the functionality of the <span class="fw">Shop</span> class. Start by loading the data below into a <span class="fw">Shop</span> object.
			<pre class="code-listing">
DATA = [
    ["milk", "Fresh from the farm", 10],
    ["bread", "Fresh from the baker", 4],
    ["tea", "Box of 100 teabags", 1],
    ["eggs", "A dozen per box", 33],
    ["ice cream", "1l box, vanilla", 2]
]			</pre>
		    </li>
		</ul>
		

		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>Create a zip file from the three Python files and submit the zip file in Brightspace using the upload link 'Lab 5'.</p>
