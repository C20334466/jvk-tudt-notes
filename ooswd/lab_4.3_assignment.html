		    Your assignment is to write a Python programs for keeping track of items
		    sold in a shop called "Groceries at your Fingertips", fullfilling the
		    following functional requirements:
		</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>
			<h4>User interaction</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>
				Except where indicated, your program may assume that user input is
				going to be valid (i.e. error handling should be implemented only
				if stated as an explicit requirement).
			    </li>
			    <li>
				Where user input is a functional requirement, suitable prompts
				must be provided, e.g.
				<span class="fw">Please enter your name: </span>
			    </li>
			    <li>
				Where output is a functional requirement, suitable descriptions
				must be provided, e.g.
				<span class="fw">Your order total is €100</span> rather than just
				<span class="fw">€100</span>.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				Communication needs to be maintained with the user for a good user
				experience, which means that output should not be limited to that
				specified in the functional requirements. For example, if an item
				is deleted as requested by the user and the program remains
				'silent', the user will be left wondering what happened. A message
				such as <span class="fw">Item successfully deleted</span> would
				contribute to a better user experience.
			    </li>
			</ul>
		    </li>
		    <li>
			<h4>User interface</h4>
			<figure class="fr twonh ml1">
			    <figcaption>
				An example of the user interface (yours does not need to be
				exactly the same as long as it displays the required information)
			    </figcaption>
			    <img src="res/images/pbl4.png" />
			</figure>
			<p>The user interface is a page consisting of two parts:</p>
			<ol>
			    <li>
				A list of the items stocked by the shop (at least two items should
				be pre-loaded at program start-up e.g. bread and milk), each with
				the following information:
				<ul>
				    <li>unique code (a positive integer)</li>
				    <li>name of item</li>
				    <li>price</li>
				    <li>number in stock</li>
				</ul>
			    </li>
			    <li>
				A menu listing the following options available to the user (a shop
				employee):
				<ul>
				    <li>add item</li>
				    <li>remove item</li>
				    <li>update item</li>
				    <li>update stock</li>
				    <li>exit</li>
				</ul>
				Each menu option should be displayed with a code to be used for
				choosing the option (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4).
			    </li>
			</ol>
		    </li>
		    <li>
			<h4>Actions</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>
				On startup, the program should display the user interface page.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				Actions should be implemented to handle the four menu options as
				follows:
				<table class="ordinary">
				    <tr>
					<th>Menu option</th>
					<th>Action</th>
				    </tr>
				    <tr>
					<td>add item</td>
					<td>
					    <p>
						Read in user input consisting of information about the
						item, including name, price and number in stock.
					    </p>
					    <p>Assign a unique id to the item.</p>
					    <p>
						Redisplay the user interface page with the list updated to
						include the new item.
					    </p>
					</td>
				    </tr>
				    <tr>
					<td>remove item</td>
					<td>
					    <p>Read in user input consisting of an item's unique id.</p>
					    <p>
						Remove the item associated with the id from the list of
						items.
					    </p>
					    <p>
						Redisplay the user interface page with the list updated
						not to include the item specified for deletion.
					    </p>
					</td>
				    </tr>
				    <tr>
					<td>update item</td>
					<td>
					    <p>Read in user input consisting of an item's unique id.</p>
					    <p>
						Read in user input consisting of information about the
						item, including name, price and number in stock.
					    </p>
					    <p>
						Redisplay the user interface page with the list updated to
						reflect the new information about the item specified for
						update.
					    </p>
					</td>
				    </tr>
				    <tr>
					<td>update stock</td>
					<td>
					    <p>
						For each item get a random number between 0 and the number
						in stock and reduce the number in stock by that random
						number.
					    </p>
					    <p>
						Display a list of items for which stock is low (2 or
						less), ask user to press any key to continue and read this
						input.
					    </p>
					    <p>
						Redisplay the user interface page with the list updated to
						reflect new stock information.
					    </p>
					</td>
				    </tr>
				    <tr>
					<td>exit</td>
					<td>
					    <p>Exit the program.</p>
					</td>
				    </tr>
				</table>
			    </li>
			</ul>
		    </li>
