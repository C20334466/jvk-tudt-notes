<h2>What is an exception?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Literally, an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html">exception</a> is a class (<span class="fw">Exception</span>) that represents a <strong>runtime error</strong>.</li>
    <li>Such errors typically make it impossible for the program to fulfill its intended purpose and prevent further execution.</li>
    <li>The exception class in Python has many <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">built-in subclasses</a> that represent different types of errors.</li>
    <li>Examples of such errors are
	<ul>
	    <li>when the <span class="fw">+</span> operator is used between a string and a number (<span class="fw">TypeError</span>)</li>
	    <li>when the access is attempted of a list element at a non-existent index (<span class="fw">IndexError</span>)</li>
	    <li>when a non-existent variable is referenced (<span class="fw">NameError</span>)</li>
	</ul>
	<details class="ice"><summary></summary>
	    <p>For each of the three error types above, write some code that causes it. </p>
