		<h2>EXERCISE 1</h2>
		<p>Define three classes called <span class="fw">Source</span>, <span class="fw">Upper</span> and <span class="fw">Storer</span>.</p>

		<figure><img class="w-three" src="res/images/assignment9.png"></figure>
		
		<p>The classes have the following methods:</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>
			<span class="fw">Source.do_work()</span> produces a random number (between 1 and 10) of random letters ('a' to 'z') and passes them (one by one) to an instance of <span class="fw">Upper</span> by calling <span class="fw">Upper.queue_work()</span>
		    </li>
		    <li><span class="fw">Upper.queue_work()</span> adds the received letters to a <span class="fw">deque</span> object inside the <span class="fw">Upper</span> object</li>
		    <li><span class="fw">Upper.do_work()</span> converts a random number (between 1 and 10, clipped to the queue length) of queued letters to uppercase, taking them one-by-one according to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) pattern from the <span class="fw">deque</span> object and passing them converted to the <span class="fw">Printer</span> object by calling <span class="fw">Printer.queue_work()</span></li>
		    <li><span class="fw">Storer.queue_work()</span> adds the received letters to a <span class="fw">deque</span> object inside the <span class="fw">Storer</span> object</li>
		    <li><span class="fw">Storer.do_work()</span> adds a random number (between 1 and 10, clipped to the queue length) of the queued letters into a store of type <span class="fw">set</span>, taking them one-by-one accoring to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) pattern from the <span class="fw">deque</span> object
		    </li>
		    <li><span class="fw">Upper.queue_length()</span> and <span class="fw">Storer.queue_length()</span> each return the length of their inner <span class="fw">deque</span> object</li>
		    <li><span class="fw">Storer.get_store()</span> returns a list of the stored values, alphabetically ordered</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The orchestration code should run a for loop e.g. 100 times, calling <span class="fw">do_work()</span> on the <span class="fw">Source</span>, <span class="fw">Upper</span> and <span class="fw">Storer</span> objects (in that order) in each iteration, and printing the length of the queues in every iteration.</p>
		<p>At the very end, it should print the letters of the alphabet not stored in the <span class="fw">Storer</span> object.</p>

		<h2>EXERCISE 2</h2>

		<p>Define a class called <span class="fw">Dictionary</span> that stores words and their definitions internally in an object of type <span class="fw">dict</span>.</p>

		<p>Use the following data as the initial content of the dictionary</p>
		
		<pre>{
"apple": "a fruit, can be green, red or yellow",
"baby": "a very young person", 
"car":	"a transport vehicle",
"deer":	"an animal with antlers",
"earth": "a planet, the one we live on"
}
		</pre>

		<p>The <span class="fw">Dictionary</span> class should:</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>allow the look-up of a word</li>
		    <li>allow the addition of words to the dictionary, one or more at a time</li>
		    <li>by default, issue a warning, without updating the word, if the addition of an existing word is attempted</li>
		    <li>provide a mechanism for the above default behaviour to be overridden, so that a word can be updated if needed</li>
		    <li>allow the deletion of a word, issuing a suitable message if the word is not in the dictionary</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Define a class called <span class="fw">DictionaryUI</span>, which handles user interactions with an object of the <span class="fw">Dictionary</span> class, allowing them to make full use of the functionality of that class. It should have a function called <span class="fw">run</span> which kicks-off the interaction.</p>
		
		<p>In the top-level scope there should be code that creates and connects a <span class="fw">Dictionary</span> and a <span class="fw">DictionaryUI</span> object and calls <span class="fw">run</span> on the <span class="fw">DictionaryUI</span> object.</p>
		<p>Complete the entire exercise in a single Python script file.</p>
