		<p>For each question identify:</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>what is the instance (the thing) we are looking at?</li>
		    <li>what is a suitable context i.e. population and sample (give an example if many are valid)?</li>
		    <li>what are the relevant properties (attributes)?</li>
		    <li>are we looking to describe, find a relationship or predict?</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Note that the answers given are only examples. The idea of the exercise was to think about data and how it needs to be strucutred for analysis an not to give the right answer (there are lots of right answers).</strong></p>
