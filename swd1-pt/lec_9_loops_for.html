			<h2>The while loop in Python</h2>
			<p>The main function of a loop is to <strong>repeat some group of instructions over and over again</strong>. The loop in code snippet <a class="xref" href="#py-while-inf">?</a> does exactly that: it prints out the number 1 over and over again. The condition is <span class="fw">True</span>, therefore always true. The call to <span class="fw">time.sleep()</span> has been added to space the iterations by 1 second, to avoid looping at a speed that hogs the CPU and freezes the computer running it. Once running, this little program will have to be stopped externally (<strong>Ctrl-C</strong> on the command line or stop button in PyCharm).</p>

			<p>Most of the time, loops are not written to run infinitely. For the loop not to run infinitely, it must be possible for the conditional expression to have the value <span class="fw">False</span> after a finite number of iterations and this is the case either</p>

			    <li>if the conditional expression has the value <span class="fw">False</span> to start with (e.g. <span class="fw">False</span> or <span class="fw">x = 3; x > 4</span>), in which case the loop statement block executes 0 times

                    <p>The variable with two jobs</p>
                    <article style="display:none">
                        <h2>The variable with two jobs</h2>

			<p>In our examples so far the variable in the condition was being calculated in the statement block only to control the number of iterations. However, loops are often used to <strong>process sequences</strong> of some kind, which <strong>naturally provide a variable that can be checked in the condition</strong>.</p>

			<h3>Example 1</h3>
			<p>Let's say we want to print out all the numbers from 1 to 10. We want the first iteration to print 1, the second to print 2 etc. - 10 iterations in all.</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>First, let's <strong>design the statement block</strong>:
				<ul>
				    <li>Because the number printed is changing from iteration to iteration, it needs to be a variable, e.g. <span class="fw">n</span></li>
				    <li>Then we can easily write the main part of the statement block as <span class="fw">print(n)</span></li>
				    <li>The last thing that is missing in the statement block is some code to change <span class="fw">n</span> between iterations: <span class="fw">n = n + 1</span></li>
				</ul>
			    </li>
			    <li>Now we need to wrap the statement block in a <strong>while loop with a condition</strong>. This takes a small bit of analysis: <span class="fw">n</span> is moving upwards by one in each iteration and we want the looping to stop when <span class="fw">n</span> goes beyond 10. So <span class="fw">n</span> naturally lends itself as the basis for the condition, <span class="fw">n &lt; 11</span> or <span class="fw">n != 11</span>.</li>
			    <li>Outside of the loop, we set the <strong>initial conditions</strong>, which in this case is done with the statement <span class="fw">n = 1</span>, as we need <span class="fw">n</span> to be 1 in the first iteration.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We can now write the short program. It is provided as code snippet <a class="xref" href="#py-var2jobs1">?</a>.</p>
			<figure id="py-var2jobs1" class="my1">
			    <figcaption>A loop designed to use a variable with two jobs</figcaption><pre class="code-listing">
n = 1
while n < 11:
   print(n)
   n = n + 1</pre>
			</figure>

			<h3>Example 2</h3>
			<p>Let's say we want to print out all the characters in a word input by the user, each character on a separate line followed by its UTF code in square brackets.</p>

			<ul>
			    <li>Again, let's design the statement block first:
				<ul>
				    <li>The character changes between iterations so must be a variable, e.g. <span class="fw">c</span></li>
				    <li>This makes it easy to write the printing code: <span class="fw">print("{0}[{1}]".format(c, ord(c)))</span></li>
				    <li>We need to move from character to character between iterations. We do not know what the characters will be, but they are in the word that we will get from the user and can place in a variable. Let's call the word variable <span class="fw">theWord</span> and we'll worry about obtaining it later.</li>
				    <li>Now what thing can be changed generically between iterations to move from character to character? Not the character itself, because there is no regularity there (from x to y to l to o p to h to o to n to e? maybe if it were always that word...). But the index of the character in the word, which can be used to get the character, can be incremented. That is a generic operation, the same for each move from one character to the next. Let's name the index <span class="fw">i</span>. Then we access the character with <span class="fw">c = theWord[i]</span> and move to the next one with <span class="fw">i = i + 1</span></li>
				</ul>
			    </li>
			    <li>To wrap the statement block in a while loop with a condition. We want the loop to stop when it gets to the end of the word. The first character has index 0 and the last has index <span class="fw">len(theWord) - 1</span>. We don't want the index <span class="fw">len(theWord)</span> to 'pass'. Also, the index is moving upwards. Thus we should make the condition <span class="fw">i < len(theWord)</span>.</li>
			    <li>Finally, we make the initial conditions <span class="fw">i = 0</span> as we  want the first index to be 0.</li>
			    <li>Also, we must remember to fetch the word before anything else.    </li>
			</ul>
			<p>We can now write the short program. It is provided as code snippet <a class="xref" href="#py-var2jobs2">?</a>. The length of the word is stored in a variable for optimisation (i.e. so that the length is not calculated in every iteration).</p>
			<figure id="py-var2jobs2" class="my1">
			    <figcaption>Another loop designed to use a variable with two jobs</figcaption><pre class="code-listing">
theWord = input("Please enter a word: ")
wordLength = len(theWord)
i = 0
while i < wordLength:
   c = theWord[i]
   print("{0}[{1}]".format(c, ord(c)))
   i = i + 1</pre>
			</figure>

			<section class="ice">
			    <p>Write a Python script that reads in three words separated by whitespace, entered by the user. The program should check the number of words entered and that they contain only alphabetic characters. If the input does not meet these requirements the program should ask the user to try again and repeat the process until the input is valid.</p>
			    <p>Next, the program should print the words, each in a new line and followed by its length in square brackets.</p>
