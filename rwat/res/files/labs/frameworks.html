	    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	    <p>For this lab you need to have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en"><strong>node.js</strong> installed</a>. If you have completed the BaaS and RxJS labs, you will have installed it already.</p>

	    <h2>Assignment</h2>

	    <p>In this lab you will work with Angular, which is an example of a client-side framework.</p>

	    <h3>1 Complete the introductory Angular tutorial</h3>

	    <p>Complete the introductory tutorial on Angular that starts <a href="https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app">here</a>.</p>

	    <p>The following notes record the solutions to problems that were encountered in a run-through of the tutorial and may help you. For any tutorial step that you complete without a problem, ignore the notes.</p>

	    <details><summary>Notes on Angular first-app tutorial</summary>
		<p>Use these notes only if you encounter problems on the indicated pages of the tutorial. They may help you solve them.</p>

		<ul>
		    <li>Page 1 (https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app/01-hello-world)

			<p>The download from the online development environment is not complete. Download by git clone:</p><pre>
git clone -b homes-app-start git@github.com:angular/codelabs.git homes-app</pre>

			    <p>Now the homes-app directory is equivalent to the first-app directory in the tutorial. However, the styles.css and app/app.component.css do not contain anything. Their contents need to be copied from the download from the ODE

				<li>Page 2 (https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app/02-HomeComponent)<pre>

ng generate component --standalone home</pre>
		</li>
		
		<li>Page 3 (https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app/03-HousingLocation)
		    <p>Similar correction as above</p>
		</li>

		<li>Page 9 (https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app/09-services)

		    <p>The baseUrl variable needs to be moved from HomeComponent to HousingService.</p>
		</li>

		<li>Page 10 (https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app/10-routing)

		    <p>Use the standalone flag when creating the details component.</p>

		    <p>Leave out provideProtractorTestingSupport() from main.ts (this causes a build problem)</p>
		</li>
		    
		<li>Page 10 (https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app/10-routing)

		    <p>I cannot remember what the problem here was. Please let me know if you encounter one.</p>
		</li>

		<li>Page 14 (https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app/14-http)

		    <p>The base url needs to be hard-coded into the db.json file, as the substitution with ${this.baseUrl} will not work.</p>
		</li>
	    </details>
	    <p>The completion of the tutorial does not carry any marks. The tutorial project directory should not be included in the RWAT repository.</p>
	    
	    <p>&nbsp;</p>

	    <h3>2 Create and deploy a small application of your own using Angular</h3>

	    <p>Your application can have any functionality but must use at least one instance of each Angular feature covered in the tutorial. The tutorial is structured to cover one feature per page, which will help you tick off the lab requirements.			    </p>

	    <p>To create a new Angular project, use:</p><pre>
ng new project_name	    </pre>

	    <p>To run the application for testing, use:</p><pre>
ng serve --open --poll=2000</pre>
			   

	    <p>Deploy your Angular application to GitHub pages. You will find help on this <a href="https://www.syncfusion.com/blogs/post/host-angular-app-in-github-pages">here</a>. This article covers the whole process from scratch, which means that you will only need parts of it. You will need to adjust the directory names for the structure of your RWAT repository (do not create a sub-repository inside the RWAT repository!).</p>

	    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	    <h3 class="red">IMPORTANT NOTES</h3>
	    <ul>
		<li><strong class="red">Make sure</strong> to add a file called <em>.gitignore</em> with the line <pre>

**/node_modules/*
		</pre>

		This will prevent the <em>node_modules</em> directory from being unnecessarily uploaded to GitHub.

		<p>If the file already exists in your RWAT repository, then add the line to the end of the file without deleting existing content.</p>
		    
		</li>

		<li><strong class="red">Do not</strong> include the tutorial project in your RWAT repository. Only include the project directory of your own application.</li>

		    
		<li><strong class="red">No marks</strong> will be awarded if the two instructions above are not complied with.</li>
			
		<li>This lab is worth <strong>2%</strong> (for a reasonable amount of work completed on it).</li>
	    </ul>
