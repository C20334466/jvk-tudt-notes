		<p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: x-large">From the <a href="lec_0_theory.html">sample question page</a> <strong>one long theory question</strong> and <strong>one long applied question</strong> (it is best to choose whatever questions seem the hardest to you) and write an answer to each of them as if you were in the exam. Send me your answers by email and I will provide feedback if your email arrives before or on the 7th of January. Please note that I will give feedback on only one theory question and one applied question per student. Also please do not send LLM-generated text as that would defeat the purpose of the exercise for you and waste my time. (Jelena)</p>
